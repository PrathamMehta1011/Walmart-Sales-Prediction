# Walmart-Sales-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting weekly sales for Walmart stores using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes store information, holiday events, fuel prices, CPI, unemployment data, and temperature values. The goal is to explore the dataset, visualize key trends, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance to understand which factors influence sales.
